Travel Assistant RAG System - Project Report
===========================================

1. Project Overview
------------------
The Travel Assistant RAG System is a bilingual (Chinese-English) information retrieval system designed to provide intelligent travel recommendations and information. The system combines advanced natural language processing techniques with modern retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

2. System Architecture
---------------------
2.1 Core Components:
- Text Embedding Module (embedding.py)
  * Uses BAAI/bge-m3 model for semantic text embedding
  * Supports both Chinese and English text processing
  * Implements chunking and language detection

- Vector Database (Pinecone)
  * Stores and retrieves document embeddings
  * Enables efficient similarity search
  * Handles large-scale document storage

- Content Processing (text_summarizer.py)
  * Summarizes English content using Gemini API
  * Implements parallel processing for efficiency
  * Maintains content quality and relevance

- Query Processing (rag_agent.py)
  * Translates queries between Chinese and English
  * Implements hybrid search strategy
  * Handles result reranking and deduplication

- Response Generation (rag_api.py)
  * Uses GPT-4 for intelligent response generation
  * Structures responses with recommendations
  * Maintains bilingual output capability

2.2 Data Flow:
1. User Query -> Query Translation
2. Translated Queries -> Vector Search
3. Search Results -> Content Processing
4. Processed Results -> Response Generation
5. Generated Response -> User Interface
